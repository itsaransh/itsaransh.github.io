# About this learning log

### **TLDR**: What am I actually doing here? 
**Basically document my journey of trying to become a strong backend + systems engineer with deep CS fundamentals**

---

This is a public learning log where I document my journey of learning **backend development and computer systems from scratch**.

I am starting from scratch kind of, and learning and documenting stuff i learn. I hope to build foundations, consistency, and understanding over time.

I made this log to:
- keep myself accountable
- record what I actually learn (and don’t understand yet)
- create a long-term record of my growth
- practice explaining ideas clearly, even when they are incomplete


## What I’m learning

My long-term goal is to become strong in **backend engineering and systems fundamentals**.

This includes (over time):

- Programming fundamentals (starting with Python)
- Linux and command-line usage
- Git and version control
- Backend concepts (HTTP, APIs, databases)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Systems fundamentals:
  - memory
  - processes and threads
  - operating systems basics
  - computer networking
- Building projects from scratch to reinforce understanding

I am intentionally trying to prioritize **foundations and depth**



## How I’m learning

I follow a simple loop:

1. Learn one concept
2. Try it out by writing code or using the system
3. Maybe break some things
4. Write down:
   - what I learned
   - what confused me
   - what I want to explore next

Most entries are short, imperfect, and written for my future self.


## What this log is (and isn’t)

### This log **is**:
- honest
- focused on learning, not performance
- a record of confusion, progress, and small wins

### This log **is not**:
- a polished tutorial
- a collection of rewritten documentation
- a showcase of expertise
- optimized for completeness or correctness

It's just my journey of trying to learn and a record on which I can look back 



## Current Tools & Setup 

- **OS:** Windows 11 + WSL 1 (Linux)
- **Languages (current / planned):** Python, C
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Logging:** Markdown + GitHub Pages (Jekyll)

The tools may change over time, but I plan to follow the same approach with some modifications


## Commitment

My commitment is to:
- learn regularly
- document my journey
- prioritize understanding
- avoid rushing ahead without foundations
