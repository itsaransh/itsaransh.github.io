# Catch-up Log — Python & Linux Foundations (During Exams)


I was not able to log due to exams, but I continued learning consistently.
This entry is a compressed summary of what I learned during that period, mainly covering Python fundamentals and Linux basics.



## TLDR
- Python programming fundamentals
- Working in a Linux environment using WSL
- Getting comfortable with the terminal and filesystem


## Python — What I learned

### Programming fundamentals
- Writing and running Python programs
- Using the Python REPL for quick experiments
- Difference between syntax errors and runtime errors
- Reading error messages and stack traces
- Understanding program flow

### Variables & data types
- Variables, reassignment, and dynamic typing
- Core types: int, float, string, bool, None
- Using `None` and understanding `NoneType`
- Variable naming conventions and readability
- Writing comments for clarity
- Multi-variable assignment
- String formatting using f-strings

### Arithmetic & expressions
- Basic arithmetic operations and negative numbers
- Floor division and exponents
- Math with strings
- In-place operations like `+=`
- Scientific notation

### Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters vs arguments
- Default parameters
- Returning values vs printing
- Functions that return `None`
- Returning multiple values
- Importance of function declaration order
- Understanding scope (local vs global)

### Control flow & logic
- Comparison operators and boolean expressions
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Conditional branching (`if`, `else`)
- `for` and `while` loops
- Using `range()`
- Loop control (`break`, `continue`)
- Importance of indentation and whitespace

### Data structures
- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, updating, iteration
- Searching, filtering, membership checks
- Adding, removing, and deleting list elements
- Tuples and immutability
- Dictionaries: key–value storage, access, updates, deletion
- Iterating over dictionaries and handling duplicate keys
- Dictionary ordering and merging
- Sets: uniqueness and basic set operations

### Errors & debugging
- Common Python exceptions
- Using `try` / `except`
- Raising custom exceptions
- Handling different exception types
- Fixing failing tests
- Debugging logical errors

### Python philosophy
- The Zen of Python
- Python’s design principles
- Python 2 vs Python 3
- Why Python 3 is the standard today



## Linux — What I learned

### Terminals & shells
- Difference between CLI and GUI
- Difference between terminal and shell
- Shell variables
- Command history and navigation
- Awareness of different shells and terminals

### Filesystems
- What a filesystem is
- Directory hierarchy and parent directories
- Absolute vs relative paths
- Navigating the filesystem
- Creating files and directories
- Moving, copying, and deleting files/directories
- Viewing files with `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more`
- Understanding the home directory
- Searching text with `grep`
- Finding files with `find`

### Permissions & users
- Linux users and ownership model
- File and directory permissions
- Modifying permissions with `chmod`
- Executable files
- Root user and privilege separation
- Changing ownership with `chown`
- Using `sudo` safely

### Programs & environment
- Compiled vs interpreted programs
- Script execution and shebangs
- Basics of the Bourne shell
- Shell configuration files
- Environment variables
- What `PATH` is and how it works
- Modifying and configuring `PATH`

### Input / output & processes
- Using `man` pages
- Command flags and positional arguments
- Built-in help systems
- Exit codes
- Standard streams: stdin, stdout, stderr
- Piping commands together
- Interrupting and killing processes
- Monitoring processes with `top`
- Core Unix philosophy

### Packages & tooling
- What package managers are and why they matter
- Installing and managing software
- Installing Neovim and trying it out as a terminal editor
- Trade-offs between package managers
- Installing tools with Webi
- Using VS Code with WSL
- Developing in a Linux environment via VS Code + WSL


## Next focus
- Build a project in python to reinforce the learning more
