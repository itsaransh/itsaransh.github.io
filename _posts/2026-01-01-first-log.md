# Starting from zero

## What I did
- set up WSL on my win11 pc
- created my learning log repo
- set up a Jekyll site for public logging

## What I learned
- WSL allowed me to run a linux environment directly on windows which is great because i will be learning linux too moving forward, trying to familiarize my with the linux env (i already knew about WSL and tried it before but installed it again and will try to to all dev stuff on there), set up WSL 1 because I have virtualisation disabled in BIOS because it has to be disabled for me to be able to undervolt my processor
- learned about Jekyll which is a great tool for simple documentation website (this is the site i made)

## What confused me
- difference between WSL 1 and WSL 2 but i finally learned it at the end(not everything most probably but i learned the difference in virtualisation i.e. vitualisation is not needed for WSL 1)
- how much i should log, what should i log, the frequency all that stuff, but i figured that i will leran that as the journey progresses

## Friction
- initial setup took longer than expected, i don't know some dependancy issue  
- Jekyll config was conflicting with some github actions build test but figured it at the end 

#### Used this great [guide](https://technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/ ) for setting up the Jekyll Website for learning log (this one)
